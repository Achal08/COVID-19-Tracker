# COVID-19 Live Updates in India via Notification and Graph
## This will provide the live cases of coronovirus in the city you reside via notification on your desktop screen and also plot graph of the Active Cases of all the Cities in India. It will also give you a text file and a pdf file which will contain all the details of COVID-19 cases of all the cities in India in form of table. And this whole thing will get updated when the program is re-run according to the stats of that time.

_In this i have used **PLYER** for notification._
_and scrapped [Government Website](https://www.mohfw.gov.in/) to get the live data of COVID-19 pandemic cases in each city using BeautifulSoup._
